#IMPORT CSV LIBRARY
import  csv
#OPEN A NEW CSV FILE. 
file = open('scraped_quotes.csv','w')

#OPEN A NEW TXT FILE. 
file = open('scraped_quotes.txt','w')


#CREATE A VARIABLE FOR WRITING TO THE CSV
writer = csv.writer(file)


#CREATE THE HEADER ROW OF THE CSV
writer.writerow(['Quote','Author'])

#REQUEST WEBPAGE AND STORE IT AS A VARIABLE
page_to_scrape = requests.get("https://quotes.toscrape.com/")

#USE BEAUTIFULSOUP TO PARSE THE HTML AND STORE IT AS A VARIABLE
soup = BeautifulSoup(page_to_scrape.text,'html.parser')

#FIND ALL THE ITEMS IN THE PAGE WITH A CLASS ATTRIBUTE OF 'TEXT'
#AND STORE THE LIST AS A VARIABLE
quotes = soup.findAll('span', attrs={'class':'text'})

#FIND ALL THE ITEMS IN THE PAGE WITH A CLASS ATTRIBUTE OF 'AUTHOR'
#AND STORE THE LIST AS A VARIABLE
authors= soup.findAll('small', attrs={'class':'author'})

#LOOP THROUGH BOTH LISTS USING THE 'ZIP' FUNCTION
#AND PRINT AND FORMAT THE RESULTS
for quote,author in zip (quotes,authors):
    print(quote.text+"-"+author.text)
    writer.writerow([quote.text ,author.text])
    file.write(quote.text+"-"+author.text)

#CLOSE THE CSV and TXT FILE
file.close()

#FUNCTION TO COUNT UNIQUE WORDS
def count_words(path):
    #OPEN THE TXT FILE SAVED FROM THE SCAPPED WEBSITE
    with  open(path, encoding='unicode_escape') as file:

        #FIND WORDS IN TEXT USING REGULAR EXPRESSION
        all_words = re.findall(r"[0-9a-zA-Z-']+",file.read())

        #CONVERT WORDS FOUND TO UPPERCASE
        all_words = [word.upper() for word in all_words] 

        #DISPLAY NUMBER OF WORDS FOUND
        print('\nTotalwords:',len(all_words))

        word_count = Counter()
        #ITERATE THE WORDS FOUND
        #INCREAMENT WHEN A NEW WORD IS FOUND
        for word in all_words:
            word_count[word]+=1
            
        print('\n Words:')
        for word in word_count.most_common():
            print(word[0], '\t', word[1])
